Prototype of my true portfolio site. 
Making sure to update this often as I added a blog section. Fixed all the visual bugs so far, this project aims to be the hub of everything to do with my Web Development career. Hopefully this is the first sapling in my career tree and will show where I came from along with being the home for all of my sites, and my blogs.
