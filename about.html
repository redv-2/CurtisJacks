        <h2>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Curtis Botting. I am currently 20 years old and studying Web Development with IT Career Switch as a trainee.
            <br>
            I am eager, efficient, motivated and love coding as I have done since I was 9 years old. <br>
            With plenty of experience in hospitality, I have spent my time working with large teams and even guiding and training staff with my exceptional ability to pick up and adapt to situations.<br>
            While I love hospitality and barwork, my dream is to work on incredible coding projects with a team and make people's quality of lives far easier with my work. Problem solving is the ultimate satisfaction for my brain, and coding is perfectly tailored to pursue that goal and hobby. With me you can expect dedication, hard work and results that never disappoint.

        <h2>My Passion</h2>
        <p>Growing up in a rapidly-changing world of new technology and advances has come with its challenges for this generation.<br><br>
        From the endless new distractions in technology and the introduction of smartphones, AI, almost unlimited knowledge is at our fingertips, and yet many fail to harness it. I have spent my young life getting to grips with this technology, making sure not to be the one left behind as we reach an age of limitless possibilities. Starting age 9, I was using scratch and gamemaker to allow my imagination
        to run rampant and create animations and games with complex algorithms of which birthed my love for problem solving with computing.<br>
        <br>This then later developed as I took Computing for GCSE, scoring a 7 and passionately completing projects in visual basic for school and for outside of school, such as a program to encrypt and decrypt sentences, and fun mini-games based on console applications such as a dice rolling competition where users have to log in before playing which takes its login information from an external file within the project.</p>

        <h2>Other hobbies and interests</h2>
        <p>Media and creative outlets have always been a huge part of my life. From learning to edit videos and enhance the atmosphere of treasured memories to producing music that projects my thoughts and ideas into a melodic form, I have the skills and passion to learn anything I put my mind to, and to do it well to a high standard.<br><br>
        I also have a passion in DJing, along with technical work for events as I have done experience in such on the Thames Luxury Charter boats previously. I can adapt, and bring new, creative solutions to creation and craft robust, personal experiences with my skills.</p>
